**My offering**  
Over 10 years, I've seen first-hand the gaps in end-of-life service provision and how people could be better supported during difficult times. I’ve also taken what I’ve learned designing services and products that transform palliative and end-of-life care, and integrated training from End-of-Life Doula UK, to offer a personalised end-of-life support service for people, friends and families.

I offer holistic support in areas such as:
- Emotional and Practical Guidance: I provide empathetic support and practical advice for individuals and families navigating the end-of-life journey.
- Psycho-Spiritual Support: I assist individuals in exploring and finding comfort in the existential and spiritual aspects of their journey, focusing on making sense of life experiences and confronting end-of-life challenges.

**My approach**  
My support service is characterised by a compassionate and holistic approach, where I aim to:
- Create a safe and supportive space for open discussion about end-of-life issues.
- Offer guidance tailored to the unique emotional, spiritual, and practical needs of each individual and family.
- Collaboratively explore and address the existential questions and challenges that arise during this life stage.

**Why work with me** 
- **Empathy and Understanding**: My approach is deeply empathetic, resonating with the emotional and spiritual needs of those facing end-of-life situations.
- **Expert Guidance**: Leveraging my training and experience, I can offer informed and sensitive advice for the various issues that face families. Though I am not a healthcare professional, many of the issues facing families are not always clinical: it impacts almost every other aspect of lives.
- **Holistic Support**: Recognizing the multidimensional nature of end-of-life experiences, I provide comprehensive support that encompasses emotional, spiritual, and practical aspects.
