#### Designing the foundations for a communication revolution

![hospice](/images/accurx.png)

**Context**  
Accurx is a pioneering health tech company, striving to improve communication in healthcare and strengthen patient care. In my role, I served as both a leader and a hands-on designer, stepping in as a “player-coach” to guide my team while contributing directly to product design, particularly on their recently acquired mobile product, [Accurx Switch](https://www.accurx.com/accurx-switch).

**Challenge**  
Operating within a rapidly scaling organisation, my challenge was twofold: to drive high-impact design outcomes and to cultivate a high-performing, resilient design team. With the added task of building structure around design practices and aligning with broader product strategies, I was committed to delivering results while fostering an adaptive, supportive team culture.

**What I did**  
To meet product demands with limited resources, I took a hands-on approach in developing Accurx Switch’s product design. I worked closely with the Group Product Manager and aligned cross-functional priorities across Pods, Product Leadership Group, and other product teams. In parallel, I introduced daily Design Drop-In sessions, transforming them into a “Design Lead Input Session” to foster a collaborative environment, enable agile feedback, and break down silos across teams.

In my role as a “player-coach,” I focused on team development by providing actionable, day-to-day guidance tailored to each individual’s goals. This included coaching direct reports on personalised progression areas, for example presentation skills for design critiques, enhancing a direct report's ability to lead discussions and elicit feedback effectively. I supported the development of structured critique sessions and adapting a 0%-20%-80% critique framework, setting a clear cadence and benchmarks to support ongoing project visibility and quality control. Additionally, my support during structural transitions, such as adopting new critique practices and high-performance principles, ensured my team was better equipped to adapt to change.

**My impact**  
As Lead Designer, I achieved impact across several fronts:
- Design delivery: Led the product design for Accurx Switch and contributed to the mobile strategy, balancing design ambition with engineering feasibility.
- Team development: Enabled my team’s growth through immediate, repeatable practices to develop transferable skills and align with long-term goals.
- Cross-functional alignment: Actively sought clarity in PLG and Pod Lead forums, ensuring design insights were well-integrated into broader strategic discussions.
- Sustained culture: Set a healthy example of work-life balance, fostering stability and resilience within the team.

**What people thought**  
*“Your management style, allowing designers space to explore solutions, fosters a supportive and creative environment. Your calm approach to busy schedules brings stability to the team, especially during periods of change.”*  
– Veron, Head of Design

*“Ivor’s leadership has opened up new collaborative spaces within Accurx. His advocacy for design’s role in product development has aligned well with our mission.”*
