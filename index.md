I work at the intersections of design, health, and human experience with a deep-seated drive to transform our relationship with mortality.

Iâ€™m committed to helping us awaken to our mortality,to not only face but integrate this inevitable process. 

I want to help to us - both individually and collectively - embrace our mortality with understanding, dignity, and grace.  

I do that through designing, writing, talking and being with people.
