I work at the intersection of design, health, and human experience. My journey has been driven by a deep-seated drive: to transform our relationship with mortality.

Iâ€™m committed to helping us awaken to our mortality, using design as a means to not only confront but harness this inevitable process. 

I want to help to us - both individually and collectively - embrace our mortality with understanding, dignity, and grace. I do that through designing, writing, talking and being with people.
